In no other time in human history graphs have been so important and so prevalent. Graphs are frequently the most natural ways to represent such complex systems as social networks, computer networks, or financial transcations. Understanding and analysing those systems is important, and driven both by the market, e.g. to achieve better ad targeting, or the state, e.g. to perform database forensincs for court evidence or to detect and prevent money laundering.

In the piece of research we are presenting here, we have joined the forces of both academia (University of Glasgow)  and industry (SAS Institute) to create a performant implementation of Strongly Connected Divide and Conquer (SCDC), an algorithm which has been recently proposed to identify strongly connected elements of directed graphs. Our work is original in that it introduces two different optimisation to the algorithm, which allow for better scalability and performance. The work required us to study the problem of determining the strongly connected compents in great detail as we build on top of many years of research, relating our work to many other papers in the discipline, starting from the foundational paper of Tarjan (1972), and more recent discoveries of Fleischer et al. (2001). Although our work is a proof of concept we show a clear direction of development to find application in bussiness analytics as well as open source intelligence and financial intelligence
