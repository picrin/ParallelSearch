In no other time in human history graphs have been so important and so prevalent. Graphs are frequently the most natural ways to represent such complex systems as social networks, computer networks, or financial transcations. Understanding and analysing those systems is important, and driven both by the market, e.g. to achieve better ad targeting, or the state, e.g. to perform database forensincs for court evidence or to detect and prevent money launedring.

In the piece of research we are presenting here, we have joined the forces of both academia and industry to create a performant implementation of Strongly Connected Divide and Conquer (SCDC), an algorithm which has been recently proposed to identify strongly connected elements of directed graphs. Our work differs from any prior work by
